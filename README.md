# Space Ships ðŸš€

Space ships is a simple journey simulator that plots a trip through the stars!
It was created as part of the [Manchester Codes](https://manchestercodes.com) Fast Track Software Engineering Bootcamp. The original project was based on cruise ships but I'm way too geeky not to try and cram space in somewhere.
